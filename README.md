# CrisisOps
CrisisControl is a C++-based simulation project that models the emergency response system of a city. 
This project is designed to showcase the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in managing real-world crises. 
The simulation encompasses various emergency scenarios, including fires, medical emergencies, and crimes, and provides a framework for coordinating responders, 
tracking incident statuses.
